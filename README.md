Final project for EC 4435 Economic Forecasting. Project involved analyzing housing sale price data from FRED, and evaluating, choosing, and applying a suitable forecasting method in R.

Methods evaluated:
* Simple methods (naive, seasonal naive, drift)
* Linear regression
* Exponential smoothing
* Arima

The chosen method involved building a simple model regressing the data set against US margin debt.
Data was forecast based on two scenarios, a decrease following recent trends, and an increase based on historical trends.
